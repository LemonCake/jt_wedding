We were walking through the beautiful Alhambra Palace in Granada during our vacation to Spain. My plan for the proposal? I didnâ€™t have one. I was armed with the ring and a song I had written in a night over half a bottle of red wine. I knew this is where I wanted to do it though. A 7 world wonder runner-up featuring stunningly intricate Muslim carvings and architecture. However, being one of the most famous attraction in all of Spain, I quickly realized that finding somewhere quiet and secluded was going to be a challenge.
