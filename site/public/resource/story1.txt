The first time I met Tina was made possible by a couple of enthusiastic friends. In fact, they had planned to have us meet months before. They say love is all about timing, and in retrospect this was the case of perfect timing. John Mayer once said this about meeting that someone special: "You just gotta wait your turn. She’s out there, he’s out there. They’re just learning what to contrast you against". By then both of us had gone on enough dates to do just that.
