Our first meeting took place at a swanky bar in San Francisco called Bubble lounge for a get together with friends. Our common friend Serena had just returned from a 6 month long stint in South Africa. "Go talk to my friend, she's single" she said to me. So I did, and ended up chatting with her for a good part of that night. We talked about everything from food to music and by the end of the night I was more than interested. In the weeks after we went to karaoke, played a lot of scramble and casually chatted on Facebook. Falling for her was inevitable. She was beautiful, had a classy temperament, and loves to sing and play tennis. She was my unicorn.
