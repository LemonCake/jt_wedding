After a month or so of courtship I decided to finally ask her out on a dinner date. That lead to another date to go hiking, and then another to play tennis. We spent hours upon hours on the phone. Sleep deprivation was a common theme during that time, but I was really happy. The happiest I had been in a long long time. She cooked delicious meals for me, I wrote songs for her. Being with her was easy and natural. Nothing was deliberate. My friend once asked me what I liked about her. I thought about it for a bit and simply replied: “Everything”.
